# Task Launchers

Task launchers let a project define repeatable work starters. Clay owns the generic launcher, while each project owns its own source, filters, prompt, and completion rules.

## Setup wizard (Project Settings → Task Launchers)

Instead of hand-authoring the files below, you can scaffold a complete setup from
the UI: **Project Settings → Task Launchers → Create task launcher**. The wizard:

1. Asks for the repo + GitHub account.
2. **Auto-discovers the repo's GitHub Projects v2 board** (project/status-field/option
   IDs) via `gh api graphql`, so you pick which columns count as "done-ish" instead
   of copying node IDs by hand.
3. Collects filters (issue type, assignee, label/title excludes), the Claude/Codex
   split, the poll cron, and the confidence threshold.
4. Writes everything: the auto recipe `.json` + prompt `.md` (and an optional manual
   `/launch` variant), a **merged** `config.json` (`autoLaunch` + a generated
   `launchApi.token` + a `triage` dashboard serve command), a `localAIConfig/TRIAGE.local.md`
   starter pre-filled with the discovered board IDs, and `localAIConfig/BUILD_DASHBOARD_PROMPT.md`.
5. Hands back a ready "paste this to an AI to build your outstanding-issues website"
   prompt (pre-filled with the repo, launch URL, token, and board IDs).

`config.json` is merged, so existing keys (and any pre-existing `launchApi.token`) are
preserved, and an existing `TRIAGE.local.md` is never overwritten unless you tick the
overwrite option. Server side this is handled by `project-task-setup.js`
(messages `task_setup_accounts` / `task_setup_discover` / `task_setup_scaffold`).

> **Which `gh` account fetches issues:** by default Clay uses the project's pinned **GitHub account** (Project Settings → Profile → GitHub account), running `gh` with that account's token (`GH_TOKEN` from `gh auth token --user <account>`). This makes fetching independent of whichever `gh` account is currently active — important if you switch accounts (e.g. for PRs), and `@me` resolves to the pinned account. Resolution order: `args.ghAccount` → `source.ghAccount` (optional recipe override) → the project's pinned account → the account git resolves for the repo → the active account.

## Files

Create task launcher files under the project:

```text
.clay/tasks/
  config.json
  github-bug.json
  github-bug.md
  README.md
```

`config.json` is optional. Each other `.json` file is a launcher recipe. A matching Markdown file can be used as the first prompt template.

`config.json` can also expose a token-gated local launch API for project dashboards:

```json
{
  "launchApi": {
    "token": "change-this-local-token",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7292/p/webapp/api/task-launch"
  }
}
```

Dashboards can call that URL with a JSON body containing `token`, `recipe`, `issue`, and `vendor`.
Use `https://` in the URL when the Clay server is running with TLS.

### Framer and other design tools

An integration can route a task through an existing Clay coordinator instead
of opening an unrelated standalone conversation. Add the coordinator's local
or storage session ID and the design context to the same launch request:

```json
{
  "token": "change-this-local-token",
  "recipe": "github-bug",
  "issue": 1782,
  "source": "framer",
  "coordinatorSessionId": "019f95a7-f854-7213-bc79-8101f3d43950",
  "context": "Framer page: Checkout. Selected component: PaymentForm. The attached task refers to the selected error state and must preserve the current desktop and mobile variants.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": "Match the selected Framer state and verify desktop and mobile behavior.",
  "ownedPaths": "Checkout payment form UI and its focused tests.",
  "clientRef": "framer-task-42"
}
```

`context` should contain the useful Framer state available when the task is
created: project/page, selected layer or component, variant/breakpoint, design
link or node IDs, annotations, and any relevant conversation excerpt. Clay
stores that context on the durable orchestration task and includes it in the
worker brief. The worker appears nested under the named coordinator, reports
progress and results back to it, and the coordinator remains responsible for
integration and the final answer.

`coordinatorSessionId` must identify an existing coordinator in the same Clay
project. Clay returns an error rather than silently creating or promoting a
conversation when the ID is missing or invalid. Omitting
`coordinatorSessionId` preserves the original behavior and starts a standalone
task-launcher session. Send a stable `clientRef` for each Framer task: retrying
the same request returns the already-owned task instead of starting a duplicate
worker.

The endpoint is gated by both the Clay auth session and the `launchApi.token`
(constant-time compared). When a request targets a specific `issue`, the
recipe's `filter` (label/assignee/`skipProjectStatuses`) is intentionally **not**
applied — naming an explicit issue is treated as a deliberate request to launch
that exact issue regardless of its project status. The filters only apply when
listing/launching issues in bulk (no `issue` given). Issue bodies are untrusted
input and are interpolated into the launched session's prompt, which inherits
the project's automation mode.

## Commands

```text
/launch
/launch preview github-bug assigned:me type:bug
/launch start github-bug assigned:me type:bug limit:3
/launch start github-bug issue:1782
```

`preview` lists matching work items. `start` creates one Clay session per item and sends the generated prompt immediately.

## Recipe Example

```json
{
  "name": "GitHub bug",
  "source": {
    "provider": "github",
    "kind": "issues",
    "repo": "trialview/v2",
    "ghAccount": "bojantv",
    "fetchLimit": 100
  },
  "filter": {
    "state": "open",
    "assigned": "me",
    "type": "bug",
    "skipProjectStatuses": ["🔄 In progress"],
    "titleExcludePrefixes": ["BE:"],
    "labels": {
      "exclude": ["backend", "legacy"]
    }
  },
  "session": {
    "vendor": "default",
    "model": "default",
    "title": "#{number} {title}"
  },
  "prompt": {
    "template": "github-bug.md",
    "includeFiles": ["localAIConfig/TRIAGE.local.md"],
    "variables": {
      "environment": "dev.trialviewlive.com (master)"
    }
  },
  "completion": {
    "marker": "WORKFLOW_COMPLETE: issue_shipped",
    "archiveSession": true,
    "closeOnUserMessages": ["mark as done", "mark it done", "ship it"]
  }
}
```

For `type:bug`, Clay treats issues labeled `feature` or `legacy` as non-bugs by default. Set `"requireBugLabel": true` in `filter` if your repo uses an explicit `bug` label.

## Prompt Template

`github-bug.md` can use these variables:

```md
Repo: {{repo}}
Issue: {{issue_url}}

Title: {{title}}
Labels: {{labels}}
Assignees: {{assignees}}

Environment: {{environment}}

{{body}}
```

Useful variables include:

- `{{repo}}`
- `{{number}}`
- `{{issue_url}}`
- `{{title}}`
- `{{body}}`
- `{{labels}}`
- `{{assignees}}`
- `{{branch_slug}}`

If `prompt.includeFiles` is set, Clay appends those project files after the rendered template. This is the right place for strict workflow rules, board IDs, PR rules, and project-specific instructions.

## Completion

Clay does not depend on provider-specific close behavior. Instead, the prompt tells the agent to end its final successful workflow message with the configured marker:

```text
WORKFLOW_COMPLETE: issue_shipped
```

When Clay sees that marker in an auto-launched task session, it closes the session window after the successful turn completes. Manual task launches close only when `archiveSession` or `closeSession` is enabled.

For shipping-style workflows, Clay can also arm completion when the user sends a completion phrase. Configure `completion.closeOnUserMessages` with project-specific phrases, or omit it to use the defaults: `mark as done`, `mark it done`, `mark done`, `ship it`, and exact `done`. If the recipe has a `completion.marker`, Clay still waits for that marker before archiving so the session can finish the configured workflow first. Recipes without a marker fall back to archiving after the next assistant turn.

This is scoped to task-launched sessions only. Auto-launched sessions close by default; manual launches still require `archiveSession` or `closeSession`.

## Dashboard Startup

Projects can start or regenerate local dashboards when the Clay project context starts:

```json
{
  "dashboards": [
    {
      "name": "triage",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "refresh",
          "command": "python3",
          "args": ["localAIConfig/refresh-triage-dashboard.py"],
          "cwd": ".",
          "onServerStart": true
        },
        {
          "name": "serve",
          "command": "python3",
          "args": ["-m", "http.server", "8765", "--directory", "localAIConfig"],
          "cwd": ".",
          "onServerStart": true,
          "detached": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Commands run from the project directory unless `cwd` is provided. `cwd` must stay inside the project.
Clay only starts configured commands; project-specific refresh logic, API calls, filters, and dashboard generation stay in the project-owned command.

In multi-user mode, dashboard startup commands run only when the daemon config has `"dashboardAutoStart": true`. Single-user mode keeps dashboard startup enabled by default.

The older single-command form is still supported:

```json
{
  "dashboards": [
    {
      "name": "triage",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "http.server", "8765", "--directory", "localAIConfig"],
      "cwd": ".",
      "onServerStart": true,
      "detached": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Auto-launch (scheduled, hands-off)

Clay can poll a recipe on a schedule and automatically start a session for each
new matching item — no manual `/launch` click needed. This is driven by
`project-auto-launch.js` and configured in `.clay/tasks/config.json`:

```json
{
  "autoLaunch": {
    "enabled": true,
    "recipeId": "assigned-to-me",
    "cron": "*/5 * * * *",
    "vendorWeights": { "claude": 60, "codex": 40 }
  }
}
```

- `enabled` — master switch (default `false`).
- `recipeId` — the recipe under `.clay/tasks/` to run.
- `cron` — 5-field cron expression (checked every 30s by the loop registry).
- `vendorWeights` — optional. Alternates the coding agent per started session
  using smooth weighted round-robin (a 60/40 Claude/Codex split interleaves as
  claude, codex, claude, codex, claude, …). Omit to use the recipe's
  `session.vendor`. A weight of `0` (or omitting a vendor) runs a single agent.

All of these are editable from the web UI: **Settings → Auto-start assigned
issues** (toggle, recipe picker, cron, and the Claude/Codex split slider).
Changes apply live — no restart needed.

On each tick the recipe is fetched and every matching item that does **not**
already have a session (dedup by `recipeId` + issue number/URL) gets a new
session started automatically. The schedule is stored as an `autolaunch` record
in the loop registry, so it survives restarts.

### Toggle from the UI

The feature can be turned on/off from **User Settings → Behavior →
"Auto-start assigned issues"**. The toggle round-trips over the project
WebSocket (`get_auto_launch` / `set_auto_launch` → `auto_launch_state`); the
server persists `autoLaunch.enabled` to `.clay/tasks/config.json` (merging, so
other keys like `launchApi` are preserved) and **reconciles the schedule live**
— no restart needed. Editing `recipeId`/`cron` is still done in the config file.

### Restricting by project status

Two complementary controls:

- `filter.includeProjectStatuses` — allow-list. The issue must currently be in
  one of these statuses to qualify.
- `filter.skipProjectStatuses` — exclude-list. The issue is dropped if it is in
  any of these statuses.

Status names must match your project's column names **exactly** (case-insensitive,
**including any emoji prefix** — `gh` returns e.g. `📋 Backlog`, `🔧 Dev Complete`).

The bundled `assigned-to-me` recipe targets `trialview/v2`'s Unified Board and
follows that workspace's `TRIAGE.local.md` "outstanding" rule — skip the
done-ish statuses, exclude backend issues:

```json
"filter": {
  "state": "open",
  "assigned": "me",
  "skipProjectStatuses": ["🔧 Dev Complete", "✍️ Ready for production", "✅ Done"],
  "titleExcludePrefixes": ["BE:"],
  "labels": { "exclude": ["BE", "backend"] }
}
```

Because `assigned: "me"` already scopes to you, the triage rule's "In progress
only if it's mine" is satisfied automatically. Label exclusion matches a label
that equals the token, starts with `token-`/`token:`/`token/`/`token `, or (for
tokens ≥4 chars) contains it — so `backend`, `backend-infra`, and `BE-api` are
excluded, while `beta` is not.

### Confidence gate

The bundled `assigned-to-me` recipe pairs auto-launch with a confidence gate in
its prompt template. The agent rates its confidence that it understands the issue
and how to solve it:

- **≥ threshold** (default 80%): it works the issue autonomously and ends with
  the `CLAY_TASK_COMPLETE` marker (the session then auto-closes).
- **< threshold**: it posts what it understood plus its questions, ends with the
  `CLAY_NEEDS_INPUT` marker, and waits for a reply.

Auto-launched sessions suppress the normal per-turn push notification; they only
ping you (in-session notification + mobile push) when the agent emits
`CLAY_NEEDS_INPUT`. Configure the markers via the recipe's `completion` block
(`marker`, `needsInputMarker`).
