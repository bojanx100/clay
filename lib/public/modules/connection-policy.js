// connection-policy.js — pure WebSocket action policy.
//
// No DOM / WebSocket / store dependencies on purpose: this is the decision core
// behind app-connection.js's sendUserAction() and zombie detection, kept pure so
// it can be unit-tested in node (see test/connection-policy.test.js).
//
// Background: a bare `if (ws.readyState === 1) ws.send(...)` silently DROPS a
// user action when the socket is missing, connecting, closing, closed, or a
// post-sleep "zombie" (readyState OPEN but the connection is actually dead). The
// app then looks frozen — switching sessions shows stale data, the refresh
// button does nothing — with zero feedback. These helpers decide when to send
// vs. recover, and when to probe a possibly-dead socket.

// WebSocket.readyState: 0 CONNECTING, 1 OPEN, 2 CLOSING, 3 CLOSED.
//
// Returns:
//   "send"      — socket is OPEN; send the action now.
//   "reconnect" — socket is not OPEN; recover and surface the reconnecting
//                 state instead of silently dropping the action.

// Decide whether to fire a liveness probe (app-level ping) to catch a "zombie"
// socket — one that reports OPEN but is actually dead. Probe only when we have
// not heard a pong within the heartbeat window and a probe is not already in
// flight. Triggered on user interaction so a dead socket is caught within the
// short wake-pong window instead of waiting up to a full heartbeat interval.

// Decide whether an incoming WebSocket frame should be processed.
//
// Background: switching projects discards the old socket (one socket per
// project, /p/{slug}/ws) and opens a new one. close() is async, so the old
// socket can still deliver buffered/in-flight frames during the CLOSING
// handshake. Those frames carry the previous project's data and must NOT render
// into the new project's view. Session ids are project-local (each project
// numbers from 1), so they collide across projects and an id check alone can't
// catch this — only socket identity can. A frame is valid only when it arrived
// on the socket that is currently active.

// Choose the session identity attached to a new project socket. A deliberate
// project click asks the server for that project's current default (user
// presence, then last viewed) instead of letting stale per-tab state outrank it.
// Explicit durable links still win, and reconnects keep the conversation that
// is already open in this tab.

// store still names the source project's active session until the target
// socket acknowledges its restored session. Never send that source id to the
// target socket, where the same number may identify an unrelated conversation.
