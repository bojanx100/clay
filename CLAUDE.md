# Project Rules

- Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines to git commit messages.
- Use `var` instead of `const`/`let`. No arrow functions.
- Server-side: CommonJS (`require`). Client-side: ES modules (`import`).
- Always commit and push completed work. Commit and push only to the `bojan` branch; never commit or push to `master`/`main`. Create the `bojan` branch if it does not exist.
- Use the `bojantv` GitHub account for all commits and pushes in this repo (clay). `origin` is `bojantv/clay`. Git auth is pinned to `bojantv` via a repo-local credential helper (`.git/config` runs `gh auth token --user bojantv`), so pushes work regardless of which `gh` account is globally active — no `gh auth switch` needed for git. (`gh` CLI commands like PR creation still use the active account, so switch with `gh auth switch --user bojantv` for those.)
- Never create PRs, merge, or comment on issues automatically. Only do these when explicitly asked.
- All user-facing messages, code comments, and commit messages must be in English only.
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `style:`, `ci:`, `build:`). Use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes.
- Never use browser-native `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`. Always use custom JS dialogs/modals instead.
- When rebuilding daemon config (e.g. `restartDaemonFromConfig()`), always use `Object.assign({}, lastConfig, overrides)` to preserve all existing settings. Never reconstruct config by manually listing fields.
- Before adding new code, read [docs/guides/MODULE_MAP.md](docs/guides/MODULE_MAP.md) to find the right file. Never add inline logic to `project.js` handleMessage. Keep modules under 500 lines.
- Never use `localStorage` for user settings or preferences. All settings must be stored server-side (via WebSocket messages or REST API) so they persist across devices and browsers.
- Client modules (`lib/public/modules/`): state goes in store.js (zustand-like), WS via ws-ref.js, functions via direct import. Never use `var _ctx = null` / `initXxx(ctx)`. See [docs/guides/CLIENT_MODULE_DEPS.md](docs/guides/CLIENT_MODULE_DEPS.md).
- When debugging stalls, phantom reconnects, resume spam, or UI lag: read [docs/guides/DIAGNOSTICS.md](docs/guides/DIAGNOSTICS.md) and check the canary logs (`~/.clay/recovery-events-dev.log`, `~/.clay/diag-dev.log`) BEFORE reading source code. A fix is not done until the canaries are quiet.
